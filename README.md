# CardinalSynth
This is a cardinal synth of EDM right here!

CardinalSynth is a synthesizer with sine, triangle, saw and square waves and noise generator.

You can change the volume of all generators with dials. Also you can change the overall volume with dial under "Master". Under the volume dials you can find 2 scaler for every wave generator. First scaler changes the semitones of your sound wave, second changes the cents of your sound wave.

UI was made with PYQT5
