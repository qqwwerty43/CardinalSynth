# CardinalSynth
This is a cardinal synth of EDM right here!

CardinalSynth is synthesizer with sine wave, triangle wave, saw wave, square wave, noise generators.

You can change the volume of all generators with dials. Also you can change the overall volume with dial under "Master".
Under the volume dials you can find 2 scaler under every wave generator. First scaler changes the semitons of your sound wave, second changes the cents of your sound wave.

UI made with PYQT5
